        I am currently dedicated to my Bachelor of Science studies in
        Information Technology, with a keen focus on the dynamic and
        ever-evolving landscape of web development. As a student, I am actively
        engaged in honing my skills as a full-stack developer, delving into the
        intricacies of both front-end and back-end technologies. This
        educational journey is not just about theoretical knowledge but also
        involves hands-on practical experience, equipping me to navigate and
        contribute to the continually changing world of web development.
